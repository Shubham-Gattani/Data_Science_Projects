# Data_Science_Projects
Here I will keep the projects which I have done to practically understand the data science concepts

Following is a brief description for each project:

1. Agriculture Data Analysis: I have performed **data analysis and visualization** on an agricultural dataset using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. Additionally, I conducted statistical tests like **ANOVA** using `scipy.stats` and built a `Random Forest classifier` with scikit-learn to predict crop types based on environmental and soil factors.
2. Outlier detection: I have performed outlier detection on a financial dataset using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. I utilized Python libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation, `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualization, and `scikit-learn` for implementing `IsolationForest` and `LocalOutlierFactor` algorithms.
